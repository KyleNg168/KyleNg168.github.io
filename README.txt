ICS HTML Website Project

	Welcome to my HTML Project! This is a website for my Robotics Team, Innov8rz, FTC Team 11039, that in the future will be used for the public to use and to sign up for our outreaches, workshops, or if they have any questions!

First, open the index.html file. You will now have access to all the other webpages in this website through the index file.

Now, you can figure out most of our general information in the Home Page, scroll up and down to see more information below.

Use the Menu in the top Right Corner to access information about our team and our competition, and also our community efforts!

Note: the sidebars and images will take out their initial formatting after becoming less than 768px so feel free to change the size of the window at anytime!

In addition, this site will later be used for students to access curriculum video's that I will lead, detailing various concepts!

I hope you enjoy this project! Please do not hesitate to give any comments or suggestions!


Sincerely,

Kyle Ng
